String Values Vertically
The program must accept N string values as the input. The program must print the first character of all N string values. Then
the program must print the second character of all N string values. Then the program must print the third character of all N
string values. Similarly, the program must print the remaining characters of all N string values as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of each string <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value.
Output Format:
The first line contains a string value containing the characters of N string values based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
