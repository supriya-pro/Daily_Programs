Sort Students based on Marks

The program must accept the name and the marks in three subjects (Maths, Physics, Chemistry) of N students as the input. The program must sort the students based on the marks in Maths in descending order. If two or more students have the same marks in Maths, then the program must sort those students based on the marks in Physics in descending order. If two or more students have the same marks in Maths and Physics, then the program must sort those students based on the marks in Chemistry in descending order. If two or more students have the same marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry, then the program must sort the students based on the name in ascending order. Finally, the program must print the name and the marks in the three subjects of the N students after sorting as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= N <= 100 1 <= Length of each student's name <= 20 1 <= Marks in each subject <= 100
Input Format: 
The first line contains N. The next N lines, each containing the name of the student followed by the marks scored in maths, physics and chemistry separated by a space. Output Format:
The first N lines, each containing the name of the student followed by the marks scored in maths, physics and chemistry separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input:
4 
xxyz 85 99 86 
stuuuv 91 92 100
efggg 85 99 72 
aabbcc 91 92 100
Output:
aabbcc 91 92 100 
stuuuv 91 92 100
xxyz 85 99 86 
efggg 85 99 72
Explanation:
The students stuuuv and aabbcc scored the same marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry (91, 92, 100). So they are sorted based on their names in ascending order. The students xxyz and efggg scored the same marks in Maths and Physics (85, 99). So they are sorted in descending order based on the marks in Chemistry. Hence the output is aabbcc 91 92 100 stuuuv 91 92 100 xxyz 85 99 86 efggg 85 99 72
