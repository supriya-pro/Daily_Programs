Substrings - Adjacent Ends

The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must print the number of substrings in
S where the first alphabet and the last alphabet are adjacent to each other in the English alphabet set. The string S is case
insensitive.
Note: The alphabets a and z are adjacent to each other (by ignoring the case).
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of substrings in S as per the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
enVIronMENT
Output:
6
Explanation:
Here S = enVIronMENT.
There are 6 substrings where the first alphabet and the last alphabet are adjacent to each other in the English alphabet set.
nVIro
nVIronM
on
onMEN
nM
MEN
So 6 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
Graph
Output:
1

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
aaAzZZ
Output:
9
