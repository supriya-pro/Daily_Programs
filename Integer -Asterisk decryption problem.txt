Integer & Asterisks Decryption
The program must accept a string S (encrypted string) containing digits and asterisks as the input. The encryption algorithm is
given below.
- The alphabets from a to j are replaced with the digits from 0 to 9 respectively.
- The alphabets from k to z are replaced with the values from 10* to 25* respectively.
The program must decrypt the string S and print it as the output.
Note: The string S is always a valid encrypted string.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the decrypted string S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
18*10*811*11*17*0210*
Output:
skillrack
Explanation:
Here S = 18*10*811*11*17*0210*.
18* is replaced with the alphabet s. Now the string becomes s10*811*11*17*0210*.
10* is replaced with the alphabet k. Now the string becomes sk811*11*17*0210*.
8 is replaced with the alphabet i. Now the string becomes ski11*11*17*0210*.
11* is replaced with the alphabet l. Now the string becomes skil11*17*0210*.
11* is replaced with the alphabet l. Now the string becomes skill17*0210*.
17* is replaced with the alphabet r. Now the string becomes skillr0210*.
0 is replaced with the alphabet a. Now the string becomes skillra210*.
2 is replaced with the alphabet c. Now the string becomes skillrac10*.
10* is replaced with the alphabet k. Now the string becomes skillrack.
So skillrack is printed as the output.

Input:
15*17*14*617*012*12*813*6
Output:
