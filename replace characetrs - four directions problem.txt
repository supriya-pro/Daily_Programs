Replace characters - four directions.
The program must accept a RXC character matrix as the input of the program.
=>if the character is T ,replace all the characters above the T character with *, and it should not replace 
the characters TBRL.
=>if the character is R , replace all the characters right to the characters with *, except TRLB.
=>if the character is L,replace all the characters left to the characters with *,except TRLB
=>if the character is B,replace all the character bottom to the characters with *,except TRLB.
and finally print the modified matrix as the output.

Example 
I/p:
3 3 
A B C 
R K L 
T L M

OUTPUT:
* B C
R * L
T L M
