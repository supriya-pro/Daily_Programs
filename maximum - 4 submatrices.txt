Maximum - Four Submatrices
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC and the position of cell (X, Y) as the input. The program must divide
the matrix into four submatrices based on the position of the given cell.
- The integers present above the X row and before the Y column in the matrix represent the top-leftsubmatrix.
- The integers present above the X row and after the Y column in the matrix represent the top-rightsubmatrix.
- The integers present below the X row and before the Y column in the matrix represent the bottom-leftsubmatrix.
- The integers present below the X row and after the Y column in the matrix represent the bottom-rightsubmatrix.
The program must print the maximum integer in each submatrix as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= R, C <= 50
2 <= X <= R-1
2 <= Y <= C-1
Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.
The (R+2) line contains X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains four integers representing the maximum integer in the four submatrices.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 6
27 39 26 36 12 30
25 84 77 52 97 34
99 87 62 28 19 21
22 72 70 47 90 73
82 68 59 33 38 96
3 4
Output:
84 97 82 96
Explanation:
Here X = 3 and Y = 4.
The top-left submatrix is given below.
27 39 26
25 84 77
The top-right submatrix is given below.
12 30
97 34
The bottom-left submatrix is given below.
22 72 70
82 68 59
The bottom-right submatrix is given below.
90 73
38 96
So the maximum integer in each submatrix is printed.
Hence the output is
84 97 82 96
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7 7
19 77 20 36 92 72 69

32 98 40 31 40 35 96
16 94 92 51 13 18 29
65 46 13 80 81 55 81
37 16 82 67 74 82 71
4 4
Output:
77 97 94 82
