Integers - Unique Digits
The program must accept an array of N integers as the input. The program must print the integer(s) in a single line until no
digit is repeated throughout the integers. In the same way, the program must print the integers of the given array in remaining
lines as the output. If there is no such integer, the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The line(s), each containing the integer value(s) separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7
12 5 98 54 71 44 123
Output:
12 5 98
54 71
123
Explanation:
The given 7 integers are 12, 5, 98, 54, 71, 44 and 123.
In the first 3 integers, the digits have not occurred more than once.
[12, 5, 98]
In the next two integers, the digits have not occurred more than once.
[54, 71]
In the 6 integer 44, the digit 4 has repeated. So it is not printed.
In the last integer, the digits have not occurred more than once.
[123]
Hence the output is
12 5 98
54 71
123
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10
28 57 49 89 81 91 60 46 66 77
Output:
28 57 49
89
81
91 60
46
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
202 115 66 4124
Output:
-1
