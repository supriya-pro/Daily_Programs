Concatenate Remove & Interlace

The program must accept two string values (S1 and S2) and a character CH (The character can be +, - or *) as the input. The
program must print the output based on the following conditions.
- If CH is +, the program must concatenate the string values S1 and S2. Then the program must print the concatenated string
as the output.
- If CH is -, the program must remove the characters of S2 in S1 (from left to right) and print the modified string S1. If all
characters are removed in S1, then the program must print -1 as the output.
- If CH is *, the program must print the characters in the string S1 interlaced with the characters in the string S2 (i.e.,
1 character of S1, 1 character of S2, 2 character of S1, 2 character of S2, ... and so on).
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.
The third line contains CH.
Output Format:
The first line contains a string or -1 based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
#ProGramming#
mango#
-
Output:
PrGrmi#
Explanation:
S1 = #ProGramming#
S2 = mango#
CH = -
So the characters of S2 must be removed in the string S1 (from left to right).
After removing the characters of S2 in S1, the string S1 becomes PrGrmi#.
Hence the output is
PrGrmi#
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
Skill
Rack
+
Output:
SkillRack
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
C@rtOOn
Spider10
*
Output:
CS@pritdOeOrn10
