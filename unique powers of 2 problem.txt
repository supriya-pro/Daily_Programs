Unique Powers of 2
The program must accept a string S containing only 0s and 1s as the input. The program must print the unique powers of
2 that can be formed using the substrings of S. The unique powers of 2 must be printed in ascending order.
Note: At least one 1 is always present in the string S.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 63
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the unique powers of 2 that can be formed using the substrings of S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
110111000100
Output:
1 2 4 8
Explanation:
Here S = 110111000100.
The unique powers of 2 formed using the substrings of S are given below.
1 (1), 2 (10), 4 (100) and 8 (1000).
Hence the output is
1 2 4 8
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
00100000
Output:
1 2 4 8 16 32Unique Powers of 2
