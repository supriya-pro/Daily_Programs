Shift Even Integers - K Times 

The program must accept an array of N integers and an integer K as the input. The program must perform the following processes K times. 
- The program must shift the even integers in the array by 1 position to the left (the odd integers remain in the same positions). 
- Then the program must print the integers in the modified array as the output. 
Note: At least two even integers are always present in the given N integers

. Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= N <= 100 1 <= K <= N 1 <= Each integer value <= 1000
Input Format: 

The first line contains N and K separated by a space. The second line contains N integer values separated by a space. Output Format: The first K lines, each contains N integers separated by a space. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
6 3 
42 15 66 72 27 32 
Output: 66 15 72 32 27 42 
72 15 32 42 27 66 
32 15 42 66 27 72
Explanation: Here N = 6 and K = 3. Initially, the integers in the array are 42 15 66 72 27 32. After shifting the even integers by 1 position to the left, the integers in the array become 66 15 72 32 27 42. So they are printed in the first line. After shifting the even integers by 1 position to the left, the integers in the array become 72 15 32 42 27 66. So they are printed in the second line. After shifting the even integers by 1 position to the left, the integers in the array become 32 15 42 66 27 72. So they are printed in the third line. 
Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 
5 1
6 17 22 18 11 
Output:
22 17 18 6 11
