Sort Engines - Performance
The program must accept the speed and the efficiency of N engines as the input. The program must sort the engines based on
the performance in descending order. The performance of an engine is equal to the product of its speed and efficiency. If two or
more engines have the same performance, then sort those engines based on the speed in descending order. Finally, the
program must print the speed and efficiency of the N engines after sorting.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Speed, Efficiency <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers representing the speed of the N engines.
The third line contains N integers representing the efficiency of the N engines.
Output Format:
The first line contains N integers representing the speed of the N engines after sorting.
The second line contains N integers representing the efficiency of the N engines after sorting.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
1 7 2 9 3
7 5 5 8 1
Output:
9 7 2 1 3
8 5 5 7 1
Explanation:
The performance of the 1 engine is 7 (1 * 7).
The performance of the 2 engine is 35 (7 * 5).
The performance of the 3 engine is 10 (2 * 5).
The performance of the 4 engine is 72 (9 * 8).
The performance of the 5 engine is 3 (3 * 1).
So the engines are sorted in descending order based on the performance.
Hence the output is
9 7 2 1 3
8 5 5 7 1
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
5 3 8 2 3 4 3 6
2 4 9 6 8 7 8 2
Output:
8 4 3 3 6 3 2 5
9 7 8 8 2 4 6 2
