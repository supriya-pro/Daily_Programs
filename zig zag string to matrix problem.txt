Zig-Zag String to Matrix
The program must accept a string S and two integers R, C as the input. The program must form a matrix of size RxC. Then the
program must fill the matrix with the characters of S in horizontal zig-zag direction. If some cells in the matrix are not filled in,
the program must fill those cells with asterisks.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 10^4
2 <= R, C <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains R and C separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
environmentcareneeded
4 6
Output:
enviro
ctnemn
arenee
***ded
Explanation:
Here S = environmentcareneeded, R = 4 and C = 6.
The number of rows in the matrix must be 4.
The number of columns in the matrix must be 6.
After filling the matrix with the characters of S in horizontal zig-zag direction, the matrix becomes
enviro
ctnemn
arenee
***ded
