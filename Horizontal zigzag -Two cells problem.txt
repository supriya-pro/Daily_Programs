Horizontal Zig-Zag - Two Cells

The program must accept a character matrix of size RxC and the positions of two cells C1 (X1, Y1), C2 (X2, Y2) as the input.
The program must print the characters from the cell C1 to the cell C2 in horizontal zig-zag direction. The horizontal zig-zag
traversal from the cell C1 to the cell C2 is explained below.
- The traversal always begins from the cell C1 and it moves towards the left in the same row K.
- Then it moves from left to right in the next row K+1.
- Then it moves from right to left in the next row K+2.
- Similarly, it moves in horizontal zig-zag direction until it reaches the cell C2.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= X1, X2 <= R
1 <= Y1, Y2 <= C
Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2) line contains two integers representing the position of the cell C1 separated by a space.
The (R+3) line contains two integers representing the position of the cell C2 separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the characters from the cell C1 to the cell C2 in horizontal zig-zag direction.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8 5
x 9 D l c
0 k F m 6
E q n 9 z
w d B k w
l n 1 B C
q 7 r G m
F p w 5 m
s 6 l w 0
3 4
6 3
Output:
9nqEwdBkwCB1nlq7r
Explanation:
In the given 8x5 character matrix, the characters from the cell (3, 4) to the cell (6, 3) in horizontal zig-zag direction are
highlighted below.
x 9 D l c
0 k F m 6
E q n 9 z
w d B k w
l n 1 B C
q 7 r G m
F p w 5 m
s 6 l w 0
So 9nqEwdBkwCB1nlq7r is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 6
q 2 p v x z
B r t E f c
6 0 9 v i d
j A j E D D
6 E c u E d
